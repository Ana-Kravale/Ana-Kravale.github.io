            Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios. Written in Java programming language.
            First made public in May 2009 before fully released in November 2011. Minecraft is now on several other platforms, and has won several awards. It is one of the 
            best-selling video games of all time.<br />
            Minecraft has three modes, Creative, Survival, and Hardcore. <br />Creative is usually used by players who like to build structures, towns, castles and much more. <br />
            Survival is.. well for... surviving. Player has to find raw materials, craft them, and use them to deffent themselves from spooky mobs that try and kill you. <br />
            Hardcore is for more experienced players, who like a challenge. Once you die in your hardcore world, it's over. And since you only have one life in this mode,
            they made it the hardest :) mobs have higher attack strength and health points. But hey...what's a game without a challenge. <br />
            The main objective of the game is to collect materials and resources, protect yourself from mobs, and explore. Then, when you feel prepared, you can put your brave pants on to
            go find and kill the final boss... <br />
            the Ender Dragon.
